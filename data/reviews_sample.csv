"6606,5664,2009-07-17,18085,Vivian,""The Urban Cottage is comfortable, beautiful, fun and really convenient!  Joyce is an amazing host and super friendly.  The Wallingford neighborhood is convenient to outdoor adventures, shopping, relaxation, and to lots of buses to downtown.  If you get a chance to stay with Joyce, I highly recommend it!  We will definitely be back again!""";;;
"6606,338761,2011-06-27,434031,Elliott,""Joyce was a wonderful host and the urban cottage is a such an awesome place to stay (quiet, clean, comfortable, private).  I highly recommend this place - you will not be disappointed!""";;;
"6606,467904,2011-08-22,976182,Allegra,""Beautiful cottage and warm hospitality from Joyce. Even though we never got a chance to see each other I felt welcome. The neighborhood is charming, quiet, and you can walk just a few blocks to good food, drinks and shopping. Joyce was super communicative and cut us a deal as we were only allowed to use the outdoor shower due to the entire house being rented. Don't let that scare you off - it's beautiful and with a little creative towel hanging 100% private!""";;;
"6606,480017,2011-08-27,997921,Brittney,""Joyce is a wonderful host! She is warm, helpful and fun to visit with. The cottage is cozy, bright and has all the comforts you could want.  I would stay here again anytime I'm in the area :)""";;;
"6606,487278,2011-08-30,206901,Pascal,""Joyce's cottage is the perfect Seattle location! It's close Fremont, Ballard and Wallingford. The cottage has everything you need with a small kitchenette and the toilet. Joyce really knows what travelers like and she provided everything we wished for. It was clean, quiet and utterly convenient. We would love to stay again!";;;

"6606,505388,2011-09-06,552477,Ivy,""Joyce's cottage and home were absolutely lovely! So private and pretty, and so centrally located in Seattle. Joyce is a wonderful hostess, offering breakfast, hot tubs, directions and suggestions. I plan on returning again and again. Enjoy! """;;;
"6606,570582,2011-09-26,1110380,Wendy,""Sweet little place, quiet, cozy, great location. Loved taking outdoor showers. Composting toilet is just fine, does make the room quite warm.""";;;
"6606,1322495,2012-05-21,2354750,Sallie,""Joyce accommodated the needs of my daughter and me on very short notice.  We were thrilled at the quality of the Urban Cottage and the guest room.  Having access to the kitchen and bath in the house allowed us to share breakfasts and coffee.  The location in Wallingford is great - walk to grocery store and other shopping/restaurants.  Joyce was helpful, friendly and kind.""";;;
"6606,1395422,2012-06-01,1845181,Susan And David,""the Urban Cottage was a wonderful place to stay for our visit to Seattle and was very nicely furnished with all that we needed in the kitchen, sleeping area and amenities. The surroundings were beautiful and quiet. Joyce was a warm and fun host.  Susan and David Askue""";;;
"6606,1575812,2012-06-27,1821528,Ivan,""Joyce was a great host and she made us feel very much at home. The cottage is in a prime neighborhood in Wallingford with easy access to nearby gas works park (we walked there). She surprised us in the morning with coffee and scones waiting for us on the patio! The garden area was very well designed.";;;

"<br/>Composting toilet take a while getting used to, but its part of the sustainable lifestyle. """;;;
"6606,1685576,2012-07-11,2703414,Susan,""Loved this cottage and beautiful yard.  This is a very quaint spot in a good location.  It's a short walk to Fremont.  ";;;
<br/>Plus there is a hot tub for the guests to use!  Doesn't get much better than this.;;;
<br/>;;;
"<br/>Joyce was a great host-very accommodating, interesting to talk to, and very helpful all-around.""";;;
"6606,1734779,2012-07-17,1657945,Robert,""Joyce is the perfect host. I cannot say enough good things about her. She is extremely friendly and generous, but also offers plenty of privacy. The cottage is small- perfect for one, very cozy for two. But Joyce thought of everything- rain jackets, bicycles, coffee, beer... She's very up on the Seattle restaurant scene, as well. Her house is perfectly situated just a few blocks from amazing restaurants, Gas Works Park (gorgeous view of downtown Seattle), and a bike trail. ";;;
<br/>;;;
"<br/>I have used Airbnb several times now, but have never had a host as thorough or as thoughtful as Joyce. I'm afraid she's set a rather high bar for the future. """;;;
"6606,1944994,2012-08-10,2163180,Matt,""Joyce was fantastic and so was the little cottage. Their's the standard stuff: The place was clean, quiet, well furnished, etc.";;;
<br/>;;;
<br/>The real benefit of this place was the little extras you'd never expect. First, their was the garden between the house and the cottage. It was gorgeous and well kept.;;;
<br/>;;;
<br/>Secondly, I happened to arrive when the plum tree in the backyard was producing some incredibly delicious plums. Yum!;;;
<br/>;;;
<br/>Third, I loved the outdoor shower. There is another shower inside but the weather was so gorgeous when I was there that it made showering outside the way to go (and don't worry, it was totally private and in no way uncomfortable).;;;
<br/>;;;
<br/>Fourth, Joyce is just a great host. There was a cold beer in the fridge for me when I arrived and on my last morning she made me a bowl of yogur, granola, and freshly picked blackberries (she had picked the berries herself a day or two before hand).;;;
<br/>;;;
"<br/>All in all, I cannot recommend this place highly enough! Perfect!""";;;
"6606,2311419,2012-09-17,3212393,Teri,""We had a great time staying at Joyce's cottage! Joyce was an awesome host and made us feel right at home. My boyfriend got sick during our trip and while I was out, Joyce brought him some juice and checked up on him. She also was great at recommending restaurants and gave us lots of guide books to check out. We traveled by car and there was always a parking spot right outside her house. The cottage was quaint and surrounded by her gorgeous garden and plum tree that were delicious! There was a compost toilet (that I have to admit, took me a little while to get used to) and a shower inside since it was too cold for us to take an outdoor shower. I highly recommend staying with Joyce! A great location in Seattle to stay in! Thanks Joyce :) """;;;
"6606,2413979,2012-09-25,3559996,Todd,""Awesome, quiet and fun! We had such a great time here and love the quaint spot in a great area of town. Host was exceptionally kind, flexible with getting in (we were in town for a wedding) and generous. Super easy spot to get around Seattle and having a picnic set up, access to parks, awesome food and more. We love this area of Seattle and the home was perfect for a couple. Amenities were fantastic and I'd suggest this as a quiet getaway for anyone that wants to experience a neighborhood in Seattle - unlike the downtown mayhem or noise of a hotel. Having lived in Seattle for years, it was really great to see how she has her cottage set up - even if you've never been, you can get a great understanding of the city - her recommendations of activities, places to eat and more are spot on. I'd highly recommend this awesome cottage any time. THANK YOU, JOYCE!""";;;
"6606,4776520,2013-05-25,6203519,Emily,""Joyce's cottage is very cute and comfortable and in a beautiful garden. We enjoyed our time in the Wallingford area. We were close to transit stops that took us downtown, to Capitol Hill, Georgetown and finally to the airport. Irwin's is a great coffee shop just a few blocks away. And Paseo's is a Cuban sandwich shop we highly recommend, also in walking distance (they only take cash). Joyce's cottage was great way for us to engage the city more like locals than tourists. Plus Joyce was very kind and accommodating, I would recommend this space for a couple or an individual. Thanks!""";;;
"6606,6784989,2013-08-25,5008872,Beth,""I really appreciated the  privacy of the wee cottage.  An inventive renovation of the garage that was  great for  a smaller person like me but might be challenging for  larger people.";;;
<br/>;;;
<br/>Joyce was gracious and accommodating.;;;
<br/>;;;
<br/>It's also in a great location. Transit downtown  or over to the University and  an easy walk up to 45th for meals or groceries. ;;;
<br/>;;;
"<br/>We will be returning.""";;;
"6606,7511677,2013-09-23,7951039,Jean,""Tiny cottage, great for no more than two, beautiful setting, close to most everything, and easy freeway access unless their are events at the college or rush hour.  We enjoyed our stay.  """;;;
"6606,7952218,2013-10-09,9069692,Ross,""Pretty good, though the access was a bit confusing. Great location, warm and comfortable.   """;;;
6606,8094378,2013-10-15,8989897,Karla,Joyce was a great host and more than accommodating to our group. The welcoming wine and bread were a very special touch after our long drive. We appreciated the hospitality. Thank you for allowing us to use your home during our trip. - the Canadian Crew.;;;
"6606,8335306,2013-10-26,8615289,Jill,""Joyce's urban cottage is lovely! Quite small, but perfect for a week in Seattle on business. The bed is especially comfortable. Thanks, Joyce!""";;;
6606,8565533,2013-11-05,1657945,Robert,Highly recommended. Joyce is very attentive but equally respectful of one's privacy. Her place is charming and in one of the most desirable locations in Seattle.;;;
6606,8670727,2013-11-11,6262889,Esther,Thank you Joyce for the lovely place to stay. I was very warm and cozy. It was very convenient to my office located just off of Northlake. Thank you and I will make sure to book here again when I need to travel to the office again. ;;;
"6606,14198624,2014-06-14,2897283,Anastasia,""Joyce lives in my dream home, complete with this quirky little cottage out back. This is the perfect place to stay in the perfect uptown Seattle neighborhood, where no hotel options even exist (do not ever book The Wallingford Inn - sounds charming but is ill frequented). Nestled between Ballard and the U. District, Wallingford is well served by city bus within a few blocks and provides a quiet retreat within a quarter hour of downtown. I lived in this beautiful neighborhood for years and really, there is no place in Seattle I would rather be. Wallyhood has a walk score of 97. Great restaurants and beautiful Green Lake for strolling.";;;
<br/>;;;
"<br/>The cottage served my needs perfectly with a kitchen serviceable for storing and reheating food and making coffee, although there are so many great coffee shops within walking distance that you do yourself a diservice by making your own. Very comfortable bed and superior cable TV and internet. There is even a hot tub on the property that I wish I hadn't been too tired to take advantage of. I hope if the need arises, that I can stay here agin.""";;;
"6606,15103705,2014-07-02,4969570,Tyler,""Joyce's little cottage was the perfect place for our trip. Comfy and cozy, close to transit and other amenities, it was great! """;;;
"6606,16020485,2014-07-20,3605722,Lauren,""This urban cottage was just as described - private, cozy and clean. Our favorite thing about it was the little garden area right outside our door where we spent the evenings after sightseeing all day. The neighborhood is lovely and we were surprised to find some really great restaurants and bars within walking distance. Joyce was a great host and even left us some warm scones outside our door one morning. Highly recommend this place! """;;;
"6606,17111733,2014-08-07,2237649,Beatrice,""The cottage was super cute and convenient to public transportation.  It was a great refuge after a busy day at a conference. Joyce left me a cold soda, which was awesome as it was a pretty hot day when I arrived.  She was a very friendly and responsive host.""";;;
6606,17698520,2014-08-16,18250896,Kathryn,The little cottage worked great for me while I was in Seattle for a week.  Nice and cozy! It has the most beautiful garden with chairs out front as well.  Really nice neighborhood. Joyce even put a beer in the fridge for me for when I arrived. :) ;;;
"6606,18012954,2014-08-20,14207237,Yukie,""Joyce's little cottage was very cute and cozy.  Having coffee, tea, water, etc. was very convenient, too.  Close to bus line, the town and shops, and a park.  I enjoyed a little table in the yard where I could sit out in the sun to eat and drink.  Perfect place to enjoy a summer in Seattle. I wish I could stayed longer!! """;;;
6606,18325808,2014-08-25,8696146,Erin,I hard a wonderful stay at Joyce's cottage!  It's a perfect little home-base for exploring Seattle.  She's a very kind hostess.;;;
"6606,18494673,2014-08-27,8926142,Jo,""Joyce was very friendly and welcoming, as was her little pup! The cottage was adorable and comfortable, and the backyard was enchanting. I made a mistake with my reservation and even ended up having to leave earlier than expected and Joyce was willing to work with me. This is a great comfy place to crash after bouncing around Seattle. """;;;
"6606,20353581,2014-09-28,2510615,Christopher,""The cottage was cozy and comfortable and within a great section of Seattle with lots of shops, restaurants, big trees and nice houses.  Joyce was super accommodating.  Great experience.""";;;
"6606,23990282,2014-12-16,8309687,Theodore,""Pictures are old, the place is starting to look a bit rundown. Mattress is stained. Host twice turned off water without notification to check her pipes for leaks - it's nice to be able to flush the toilet and wash your hands after using the bathroom in the morning.""";;;
"6606,30429568,2015-04-21,1271973,Amy,""This was my second booking for the cottage with Joyce.  The first was an extended stay, the second a recent weekend.  The cottage is very comfortable and the garden is lovely on a sunny day.  The bed is extremely comfortable"; the fridge is just big enough for everything you need for snacks and beverages for lounging in the garden or a picnic at Gas Works Park a short ways away.  There are a huge range of dining places in walking distance.  A relatively new one and a favorite for me is Bounty on 45th and Stone way--comfortable coffee shop ++ where you can get grilled sandwiches, coffee, beer (including growler fills!) and free movies and popcorn on Friday nights.;;
<br/>;;;
<br/>Contrary to what another previous guest suggested, I found the photos to be an excellent reflection of the space.  It was very clean, comfortable, and well appointed for everything I needed.  Joyce is great--helpful and extremely warm and friendly but not at all obtrusive.;;;
<br/>;;;
"<br/>Highly recommend the central location, this space, and Joyce as a terrific host if you are planning a trip to Seattle!""";;;
"6606,33718937,2015-05-31,31376147,April,""Joyce was out of town when we got there but  made sure everything was ready for us.   The place was cozy and beautiful.  The garden was certainly a highlight, we enjoyed eating outside, and hanging out in the hot tub. Awesome neighborhood!  When she got there she was super helpful, also her dog, Cleo, is awesome!";;;
<br/>;;;
<br/>;;;
<br/>Some things to note before your stay.  Not necessarily cons, but things you may want to anticipate:;;;
<br/>;;;
<br/>1) The internet wasn't great, but when Joyce rebooted it, it was much better.  But then the next day went back to being less than great.  Joyce also offered up her basement for us to use since it had better internet.;;;
<br/>;;;
<br/>2) The toilet is straight up in the shower, and the shower is straight up in the kitchen, which was not to my liking really, but I get grossed out kind of easily.  It was plenty clean, it just weirded me out.  ;;;
<br/>;;;
"<br/>3) It's quite small.  This was great for me and my sister since we grew up in a tiny room together, but I wouldn't want to be there with a romantic partner, especially not a smelly one.""";;;
"6606,35797188,2015-06-22,16767993,Kurt,""We had a very nice stay in Joyce's quaint and cozy cottage. Very comfortable and great location, wonderful garden and easy street parking. Would highly recommend for a single or intimate couple. """;;;
6606,36275527,2015-06-27,15737413,Chris,Joyce's spot is amazing!  I stayed there just under a week and it was perfect for me.  The spot is small but she makes that clear and for the price and location it's unbeatable!  Can't wait to book again;;;
"6606,36806825,2015-07-01,15980634,Meaghan,""Joyce wasn't at the cottage for our arrival, but her communication prior to our arrival was great.  She even greeted us one morning with delicious, piping hot scones!  The cottage itself was very charming and cozy--perfect for a couple or good friends.  A great place to come home to at the end of a day of exploring, and it was so conveniently located to a number of neighborhoods and also a short walk to the main drag of Wallingford and public transportation.  But if you're looking to cook to save a bit o' cash, I feel that the kitchen is serviceable for only very basic things (coffee, storing leftovers, etc.).  As noted in other reviews, the bathroom and kitchen are one space--didn't bother us too much, but some may not be everyone's cup of tea!  All in all, a cozy, conveniently located spot with a lovely garden in a great neighborhood.  Thanks Joyce!""";;;
"6606,37750582,2015-07-10,28968121,Swaati,""Joyce is a wonderful, kind, thoughtful and the warmest host I have met on AirBnB. She is very understanding and very accommodating. She gave us all the necessities and then some (yummy warm breakfast scones!). She was very responsive to our needs. """;;;
"6606,38386856,2015-07-15,7108244,Chhaya,""Joyce's cottage was great and a great deal. Very cute and perfect for a single person traveling alone or two people who don't mind the lack of door on the bathroom. As previous commenters have noted, the toilet is indeed inside the shower, and the whole bathroom sits inside the kitchen...but everything you need is there and works perfectly. The outdoor space is a really nice perk, too. ";;;
<br/>;;;
<br/>The cottage is closer to Wallingford than Fremont but easily accessible to all the tourist sites by bus (schedules and bus stops are easily findable on the Google Maps app on your smartphone). The Burke-Gilman bike path is nearby and Green Lake is also beautiful and within walking distance. ;;;
<br/>;;;
<br/>The kitchen isn't really made for cooking but is perfect for leftovers, picnics and morning coffee. The internet/wifi was spotty and intermittent - worked better to power the tv than it did my phone - but I also didn't bother to reach out to Joyce to ask her to reset the modem so it's possible it would've worked better if I had. AT&T got fine service though so it worked out fine for me. ;;;
<br/>;;;
"<br/>The photos in the listing are accurate or maybe even undersell the place, since it's a quite nice place to stay and is very charmingly put together given the space constraints. I'd happily stay there again. """;;;
"6606,39280788,2015-07-22,33503384,Sandra,""Joyce was awesome.  She was so friendly and hospitable.  Everything was clean and prepared for us. She had a plenty of Seattle information available for us to check out (magazines , maps etc.) .  The neighborhood is  residential and quite. But, it is a hop, skip , and a jump away from EVERYTHING"; restaurants/bars, cafes,grocery store, drug store, shops! I left my art supplies at home. My fingers got restless for my sketch pad. All I had to do was get on a bus and ride for 5 minutes. It was so awesome I walked back to the cottage. I liken it to Wicker Park in Chicago.  ;;
<br/>;;;
"<br/>We did some touristy stuff and didn't have a car. We used Lyft and  from where we were located and depending on the time of day (traffic can be nuts) the rides cost  between $7-$25. The location is pretty central to even the touristy places """;;;

6606,47077952,2015-09-15,41894012,Matthew,Quaint and quiet little cottage in the heart of one of the nicest neighborhoods in Seattle. We were visiting for three days and couldn't have asked for a more homey feeling in our stay. Joyce has set up a place for guests that she would stay in herself and the personal touches were evident. The price was great as well. ;;;
"6606,47664724,2015-09-21,14608030,Tim,""The Urban Cottage was just as described and in photo's.   The bed was very comfortable, and all the needs for a short stay.   Parking was never a problem, and communication with Joyce was simple.""";;;
6606,49004413,2015-09-30,40308378,Susan,The neighborhood is beautiful and a perfect location for us. The photos and description were completely accurate and representative of the cottage space.  ;;;
"6606,54613026,2015-11-22,46672070,Erin,""The cottage is an adorable little place, equipped with all of the essentials and even some toiletries in case you forgot your own.  Joyce is the sweetest hostess – she even had champagne and snacks waiting for us upon arrival since we were celebrating our honeymoon.  The location was great, walking distance to some fun neighborhoods, and a short uber ride to downtown.  We were only there for two short days, but felt that we had a more local experience of living in Seattle in the little cottage!""";;;
"6606,55230464,2015-11-29,8136995,Kimberly,""The apartment was as expected. Clean, cozy. I appreciated that Joyce had left out biscotti, hot chocolate, pop corn... a very nice touch!""";;;

She had also prepared some maps for us and listed her favourite restaurants and we used both tools and were not disappointed.  The location was perfect and we could take a leisure walk to downtown - we were very close to very cool, affordable food, coffee and drinks and even a few blocks away from a live music venue! The cottage was well stocked and clean and had plenty of instructions, it was a very enjoyable stay!""";;;
"6606,72736017,2016-05-04,67311536,Mari,""Great, cozy place surrounded by a beautiful, zen garden.  It reminded me of a cozy hut in Belize wrapped up in a cute Seattle home.  The area was quiet and centrally located as Joyce mentions.  Lastly, Joyce was wonderful and helpful.  """;;;

The garden was lovely and the weather was perfect for sitting outside and enjoying a cup of coffee and watching the hummingbirds flying around. The bed was comfortable and the snacks are a nice touch. I knew I wasn't going to be around too much, so I just needed a really just needed place to sleep, so I didn't get a chance to watch TV or use the hot tub.

<br/>Joyce heeft vooraf zeer attent geanticipeerd op wat je als gast nodig hebt via emails. Jammer dat ze er niet was toen ik arriveerde. Een mail van haar om me daarover te informeren had ik jammer genoeg niet ontvangen. Graag had ik gedurende mijn 11 dagen in het appartement met haar kennis gemaakt. Wij beiden hadden een druk bestaan, denk ik, en daardoor is dat niet gelukt. ;;;
<br/>De cottage zelf heeft alle voorzieningen die ze had beschreven en ook het internet werkte prima, behalve de laatste dag.;;;

6606,82788906,2016-06-29,8265319,Antonia,Super cute place.  Had everything I needed.  I could walk anywhere.  Joyce was lovely.  If you want to stay in the area for under $100.00 you can't beat it.;;;

"6606,84987647,2016-07-10,58581831,Aaron,""The cottage was in a quiet neighborhood with many shops and restaurants within walking distance (about 0.5 mile away) and bus stops nearby. The photos of the cottage painted an accurate picture of the place. The shower/bathroom combo in the same room as the kitchen was a bit awkward at times, since the person using the shower or toilet was shielded from view by anyone in the kitchen via a clear shower curtain.  However, it was a quaint homey place with a cheery hospitable host and friendly puppy. We enjoyed our stay there!""";;;
"6606,86470845,2016-07-16,16403357,Lydia,""Joyce's urban cottage was perfect for me and my boyfriend. When we arrived, the cottage was stocked with wine, cookies, fruit, and various other food items. We were provided with everything we needed for a comfortable stay. The toilet and shower are fairly open and directly off the kitchen, so if you're traveling with a companion, note that you're going to be up close and personal. It's a small, cozy space, and Joyce has definitely made the most of it! The location was great—about a fifteen-minute walk to the Fremont Troll and Gas Works Park, and a quick Uber ride everywhere else. There's also a bodega down the street and a 7-11 within walking distance. We met Joyce and her dog Cleo, and they were both welcoming and happy to share their home and neighborhood. Joyce was communicative, friendly, and very helpful. This is a beautiful little place, hidden away in Joyce's lovely garden. Highly recommended!";;;

6606,90568011,2016-08-01,82172823,Michael,The host was polite and offered us fresh plums off the tree in the backyard. The picture of the backyard is true but doesn't convey how very small the converted garage space really is. Guests need to understand that there is no A/C.;;;

The kitchen, bathroom, shower is all together in about a 4-5 foot area. There is no working hot tub - it looks to have been out of commission for quite a while. We tried to turn the air-conditioning on, but there was a cover super glued to the outside where we could turn on / off. The door to the kitchen/bathroom fell off the hinge before we even tried to close it, and wouldn't go back on.<br/>Don't get me wrong, we were hardly in the cottage so it was a fine place for us";" however, if you're expecting a semi-spacious area, this is not nearly as big as it looks in pictures.

It's in a nice central location (with easy walk) between Green Lake, Fremont, Gasworks Park, and the university, and the bus stop is right near her place! As others mentioned, the cottage is small, but it met my needs as a business traveler who leaves a small footprint (and likes adventure). She has a couple of Airbnb's here, so make sure you go to the right one (each is named). I would stay again, especially if I was on a budget.""";;;

Joyce's place is fully equipped and accomplishes comfort in small space. It was quite hot during our stay but the fans were so helpful we didn't even have to run the air during this crazy once in a blue moon heat wave. Her bed is soooooo comfortable!

The place is very small but does have everything you would need.  Loved the bed and quiet neighborhood.  Caught up on my sleep!  The only thing I had a hard time with is the combined toilet and shower area.  I have a bad back and can't bend very well.  The toilet is small, low and the seat moves around.  Not ideal if you have any physical limitations.  Other than that, comfy and easy to get pretty much anywhere.  Make sure to meet Cleo, she's a sweetie.""";;;

The cottage was clean and well kept, and just enough space for two people on a short vacation. If we had been staying longer the tiny kitchen area and camper-style bathroom/shower combo might have eventually felt too small, but for our 3 day trip was just right. Overall, everything was as we expected from other reviews and we would consider staying here again on our next visit.""";;;

The place is in an adorable, walkable neighborhood with everything you could need (including a grocery store) just a few blocks away.  Downtown Seattle vistas can be seen just by looking down the street, and we were able to easily get to all of our destinations (inside and outside of Seattle) during our stay.  Joyce was friendly and easy to communicate with.<br/>CONS: As another reviewer said, everything felt kind of jury-rigged together, like if you bumped something the shelves would come crashing down.  There are wooden planks in the shower that aren't in the photos";" these are so you don't have to stand in water.  The drain doesn't function well and there was standing water left around as late as 24 hours after a shower.  You can't set things on the little counter set up on the fridge, because the fridge is crooked and it will roll right off.  There was a wet patch on the carpet in the bedroom that never dried.  The dresser was put on little blocks to prop it off of the wet spot.  There was a faint sewage smell during our stay that I suspect was due to the drains.  Finally, I wasn't able to tell this from the pictures, but heads up that the kitchen is the same room as the bathroom.  It felt unsanitary and we didn't prep as much food as we had planned to as a result.<br/>It was a great deal, we loved the location and the garden.

"6606,508423769,2019-08-12,18984568,Sarah,""Joyce's home is located in a great neighbourhood – very central. It felt totally safe walking around at night and it was close to the main attractions – great for a first trip to Seattle! The place is basically what is pictured and described – very small but fine for a couple. However, I would not recommend it for a long term stay.  When we booked, the listing stated """"free parking on premises"""" which we assumed meant a driveway, but be aware that there is only street parking. We never had trouble finding a spot close to the house, however it did get quite busy later in the day. It's also good to note that the wifi was extremely slow.<br/>We were very disappointed in the cleanliness of the place. Although tidy and clean at first glance, it was quite dirty and evidently had not been deep cleaned in a long time. Overall it was very dusty and covered in thick cob webs and a few dead bugs on the ground. The tiles in the shower are not sloped properly and, regardless of using the squeegee, the shower kept a musty smell that only got worse days after using it. The soap that was provided in the shower was a used bar of soap. The long shower curtain separating the kitchen from the bathroom was also very grungy. We did bring up these concerns with Joyce and she refunded us our cleaning fee with no questions asked. <br/>Overall it was okay, but just okay. It's advertised as a cottage and it feels like one.""";;;

However, the second I walked through the gate into the backyard, the place was as welcoming and tranquil as it looked online. The cottage is mostly bedroom, with a bathroom and small shower tiled off in the kitchen area. It was reminiscent of a camper bathroom and kitchen. There wasn't a way to cook food, so come prepared for that. But the microwave and mini fridge were perfect for storing leftovers, and Joyce gave some great recommendations for places to visit.

<br/>Angielena Chamberlain is a very cool and talented hostess. We shared her wonderful art studio with her, 4 rescue cats, and an adorable Jack Russell Terrier. The room was small and quaint with a comfortable feather bed. There were towels and fluffy bathrobes laid out for us to use. ;;;

Her studio is quite an interesting place in itself, and so is the neighborhood. It's extremely convenient to get to downtown and beyond as it's directly on the route of bus 106 and takes about 10 min (only $2!) to get there. Getting further to Fremont area or Airport was also very easy. If you are concerned about the animals, they are very very quiet, affectionate and non-intrusive - so don't let that stop you. Angielena was kind and helpful - she helped me find her place/got a ride because I was a bit lost in the area when I first got there and also gave me tips on places to check out. A very good experience - just one star short, coz I missed having a mirror in the room. But that's just me - I was on a short vacation, and I wanted to look nice in my photos for facebook and kept running to her other mirror :) This was not an inconvenience in any way though - just in case you wonder why I said nice things and gave one star less! =)";;;

Although her studio was above the Jules Maes Saloon, I slept comfortably—it wasn't noisy at all, and loved waking up to the historic view of Georgetown's brew house and Seattle sky. Angielena was kind enough to drop me off at the Earthwise salvage shop —there are so many antique and vintage shops in this area! And how could I forget having a delicious, hearty and healthy breakfast with her at Hanger Cafe. It was also relaxing to just spend the night in her artist studio, but alas I had to get on with my travels. ";;;

<br/>;;;
<br/>About Angielena: She's a gorgeous painter, and she's made the space into something special.  She's also incredibly helpful, and so fun to talk to (wish we could've chatted more, but I was out sightseeing, mostly).  She's laid out transportation and sightseeing guides in the guestroom, and a fluffy white robe and a basket of toiletries (She also has an impressive teadrawer:).  Her little dog Savie is a darling, and the cats are as lively as houseplants.  ;;;
<br/>;;;
"<br/>About staying in Georgetown: I'd never been to Seattle before, and was worried about proximity to """"important things"""".  There is a bus stop literally across the street that gets you where you want to be in 20 minutes.  And along the route is the Goodwill OUTLET store.  Not to be missed.  Goods by the pound.  Never would have seen it unless I was staying in Georgetown.  Between SEATAC and downtown, Georgetown is adorable AND industrial.  Like, they sell plane propellers down the street, but they also sell gourmet veggie reubens, microbrews, and espressos. There is a motorcycle club, but there's also Fantagraphics, the comics publisher.  Geeks and foodies and artists align.  ";;;
<br/>;;;
<br/>The Bella Vitale Studio is above an actual SALOON.  Hilarious.  But NOT AT ALL noisy.  There's lots of insulation, I guess, because in three nights I never heard a peep.  On my next visit, I'm going to forgo the typical Seattle sites, and spend more time in Georgetown.  There's plenty to see and do and eat there.   ;;;

Her place was very clean and well kept and my parents thoroughly enjoyed their stay as well as loved getting to know her.  I would definitely recommend her as a host and the excellent location of her studio""";;;
"9419,419305,2011-08-04,399158,Varun,""This was a hard review to write, because this spans both ends of the spectrum. I've done a fair amount of Airbnb, and almost always have extended my stay wherever I have lived, but this was different. I left the first chance I got (which was rather soon, a couple of hours). ";;;
<br/>;;;
<br/>First, let me begin with the good by saying that whatever little time I spent with Angielena, and the pre-arrival exchanges, she was very nice, gracious, and seemed like a very cool person I could have really gotten along with. She maintains a nice, clean, artsy place. ;;;
<br/>;;;
<br/>Now let's talk about the place, and the rental / value aspect of the whole package. The neighborhood is a bit run down; there are demolitions and teardowns happening literally right across the street, it is noisy in the daytime as it is also right under the landing path of the airport, and I saw a fair few unsavory characters at the intersection near the place, so I'd be worried about going out in the night. ;;
<br/>;;;
"<br/>Inside, the bathroom too is rather tiny, and quite a bit across the hall to make it inconvenient. Also, the listing says the room is 250 Sq Ft, which would be a decent size room, but in reality the room is rather tiny. Maybe a bit more than 9 feet by 12/13 feet, with an angled wall at one end. Even the tiny closet was almost full..  In a city where a 3 star hotel room with breakfast can be had for as few as US$100/day, this doesn't really offer great value, or great convenience, considering it is in a rather inconvenient part of town.

<br/>First, there was unexpected loud construction outside of the apartment in the morning and she called the construction company to see if they would either postpone some of the construction or pay for a hotel room for us. Also, we arrived later than expected but she still moved her schedule around so that she could be at the apartment when we arrived. ;;;
<br/>She was friendly and warm without being intrusive or over-talkative. It was very much like staying at a friend's place. ;;;

"9419,491201,2011-08-31,684425,Mary,""Angielena is the most charming hostess you can imagine. If you like artists, you will enjoy staying here because Angielena's home is also her studio. She has three adorable cats and a sweet dog, and they are kind spirits in the place without being forward with their presence. Note that Georgetown is a true artists' community and therefore on the cutting edge. If you want to stay in a well-touristed area, you would be better off downtown. Georgetown has a certain grittiness and can seem deserted if you come in after 12 a.m. or so on a week night. If you have a sense of adventure, however, and want to stay in a non-touristy area, Bella Vitale is a good choice. Angielena is very personable and generous with information about Seattle and a lot of fun to talk to. Another bonus is that it is very easy to get to Bella Vitale from the airport but also easy to get downtown from Georgetown on the bus.";;;

"9419,1043387,2012-03-26,1722859,Jesse,""The space is noisy and never truly dark, but that is part of being in a city and, with how busy we kept ourselves, it wasn't too much for us to sleep. Angielena is a charming and generous hostess, and her dogs are sweet, if a bit yippy. A cozy, stylish space and a comfy bed, what more could you really ask for?""";;;

The room is in an art-filled loft space in a culturally happening neighborhood. The house dogs and cats have lots of personality without being annoying. Pretty much everything was good except that the bed's mattress was squeaky and sagged in the middle, but Angielena mentioned it's slated to be replaced after my stay so it shouldn't be an issue in future. There's easy bus access to downtown Seattle right outside the door. Angielena is a gracious host, flexible and easy to communicate with. Overall, a great place to stay.";;;

She hosted me for a week, and I couldn't have asked for a better experience staying in a great little neighborhood I stayed here as my first stop after moving to Seattle for work. Angielena is very helpful, accommodating and such a sweet person. She is a new friend I have made in this new city. The house pets are very lovable, friendly and easy to fall in love with. You sure will miss them when you leave.";;;
"<br/>There are plenty of local restaurants and stops worth enjoying. The bus stop is right across the street and the bus takes you to downtown in 20 min and if you plan on frequent trips I would recommend getting the ORCA card from one of the machines on any of the Link stations. """;;;

She is a fantastic host--gracious and full of recommendations for meals, sites, neighborhood adventures, and in house yoga classes. The building as a whole is in a remodel phase (which was  not at all a detractor), but our room and bathroom were absolutely perfect.  The neighborhood is great--it has a well developed sense of community, a good mix of shops, a couple galleries, a delicious diner on the corner, a great bar just up the block, and a handful of other tasty looking restaurants scattered around.

<br/>Good: artsy, down to earth, clean, SHOWER from the Gods, close to great restaurants, easy on/easy off for Freeway and bus.;;;
<br/>Caveat:;;;
<br/>bathroom and kitchen down hall. Being a first timer, I guess I really didn't check it out as well as I should have to know that.;;;
<br/>Occasionally a little noisy with motorcycles but this is a very random occurrence. ;;;

I was surrounded by some amazing food as well. Angielena was an amazing hostess, her suggestions for places to visit were spot on. La Catrina is a must, the bar downstairs, and the authentic Italian pizza place around the corner. I didn't get to explore as much as I wanted because I was up for a class, but I'm excited to come back again, and will definitely be staying in Georgetown! :) """;;;
9419,15355937,2014-07-07,16925288,Sean,The stay in Georgetown was cool.  One of the more highly rated breweries in seattle is right down the road.  Its only a few minutes to downtown.  Angelina was very nice she told us all about what was around and was very accomodating.  Some loud motorcycles across the street would be my only complaint.   I was there for only a couple days and cant wait to see Seattle again.   I was happy with where we were as it seemed to be a better neighborhood than  downtown.;;;

9419,16109927,2014-07-22,15689338,Callie,We really enjoyed our stay in Seattle. The area is very interesting and artsy which we both appreciated and the room was cute. We felt that we were able to get around by bus fairly easily and there was also some cute places to eat around the neighborhood. The Mexican place down the street is amazing and has a really great friendly staff. Angielena was helpful and was quick to respond via text if we needed something.  The building itself is very unique and I enjoyed the old-fashioned vibe. We also met a few artists who were very nice. I would definitely recommend. The bed is a bit small for two but we slept well enough.;;;
"9419,16267445,2014-07-24,601994,Kathy,""Angielena was a warm and professional host. After we mentioned the possibility of a trip to Mt. Rainier, we later found a guide book waiting outside our door! We got to meet a number of other artists and travelers in the building, all of whom were quiet and respectful during our stay. The neighborhood is fun and inviting. Downtown is a safe and convenient bus ride away. Be advised, late night buses to Georgetown might attract some shady passengers. The room was clean and comfortable. However, sleeping with the windows open did prove problematic at times -- the building is close to both an air field and a freight rail yard. All in all, a cute room with a great host!""";;;

Overall just a lovely person! The new bathroom was beautiful and the air conditioning unit in the room is great. As long as the windows are closed the airplane noise is really no issue. Georgetown is such a cool area, we were so happy we stayed there and were forced to check out other neighborhoods besides just Downtown. Highly recommend Hangar Cafe for breakfast!""";;;
"9419,17018330,2014-08-05,18865341,Kate,""Angielena was an excellent host. The welcome tour gave us an thorough and hilarious lay of the land that was to be our home for four days. All basic amenities were supplied, including the use of a full kitchen (fridge, toaster oven, microwave and a few dishes were provided in the room for easy access), and accommodations were quite comfy. Being that the room is located in Georgetown, we were easily able to escape the busy downtown scene at anytime with the use of the transit system and escape back to our comfy little corner of town. All in all, it was just what we needed, it was the perfect little get away.""";;;

She's a great host and has tried to think of a lot of the details to make you feel welcomed in the space. Room was clean, building was unique & interesting, & the residential artists and other guests were quiet. I think there's probably street traffic noise in the morning (it was a weekday), but I sleep with earplugs so no problem for me. I also liked the neighborhood--northeastern, industrial, arts feel to it. """;;;

It had great bars/breweries for drinking, and coffee shops for writing. It's not too far from the airport, so you get a lot of airplanes overhead, but I liked being able to see the planes up close. The bathroom was amazing and the bed comfy. It was really cool to be staying somewhere with a kickass artistic community and mission. Would love to stay here again. """;;;

<br/>LOVED the neighborhood - hip industrial style bars, cute restaurants converted from old houses, and right outside our window was a flea market housed by trailers. So cute.;;;

She gave me an enthusiastic tour of their lovely historic building & amenities & is definitely passionate about what she does there and enjoys sharing the neighborhood. Helpful, cheerful, just the best. The room was as described (and cuter!) with plenty of room to kick back & relax in the sitting room after a long day. The bed was comfy ( I slept really soundly) & that shower! You simply must see it for yourself. The other residents & guests I met were exceedingly polite & welcoming. I love the care taken with restoring this building & enjoyed being surrounded by the artistic atmosphere. Georgetown is an amazing little eclectic neighborhood with superb food & drink choices.

Free off-street parking is available.  If you don’t have a car, you can access the bus right across the street in front of the building, which is nice.  During our 3-night stay, we greatly enjoyed Angielina’s warm hospitality.  She was personable, very helpful and attentive to our needs.  She recommended several local restaurants and events, like the St. Gennaro (Italian) festival on Saturday night.  The bed was comfortable and the room of adequate size.  Overall, we found the room and building pretty much “as advertised.”  The large bathroom was well stocked with all the essential personal care products.";;;
<br/>;;;
"<br/>We found several local restaurants to be excellent:  The downstairs pub, a superb Mexican place, and the Hangar Café (breakfast and lunch).

"9419,38127346,2015-07-13,1106187,David,""Angielena was a delightful and helpful host. She was kind enough to welcome practically my whole family--two parents (including myself) and a baby in the Golden Sun room, two grandparents in the Toulouse Lautrec room, and an uncle in the calm green room. The Golden Sun room's side room was a nice place to gather, with two comfy chairs, a small fridge, and toaster oven. It was also easy to make some coffee in the communal kitchen. The shared bathroom never posed a problem"; there is actually a second, smaller bathroom besides the Barry White bathroom, and at least one was always available. We stayed over the second weekend of a month, which means we got to enjoy the Georgetown Art Attack, a neighborhood gallery walk with a central corridor right around this AirBnB location, plus a couple of other locations (Equinox Studios and Studio E) reachable by the frequent shuttle service. Get started early on the Art Attack. There's lots to see. End your night right downstairs at the Trailer Park Mall, where, when we visited, a singer and guitarist were playing some gypsy/cabaret/jazz/bossa music. They stayed open later than the rest of the walk. The next day was also the Georgetown Garden Walk, where the neighbors and parks show off their gardens and backyards and produce. The host Angielena was working at the Urban Farm and Food Forest, a new enterprise on the southern edge of the walk. There's lots of good food, beer, bars, and coffee around. Some spots had irregular hours, but we were never left without options. There's also the Carleton Avenue Grocery (the oldest in the state, with friendly owners, and astrong wine selection, especially for a corner market) ~10 min walk away. If you're staying at the Georgetown Art Center, you're probably also interested in visiting downtown Seattle. Luckily, the bus stops right in front of this location, and can get you downtown in about ~15 minutes (though we found the wait on the return trips to be a little slow. Try to time the return). A smaller group could make good use of Uber. The only real drawback I'd point out is that there's a county airport just to the south (not SeaTac, King County). Most of the planes that fly over are small jets and little private planes, but there were a couple freight planes that were fairly jolting. This was most noticeable in the Golden Sun room;" my parents in the Toulouse Lautrec room didn't notice it as much. So, yes, we had a terrific time staying here and exploring Georgetown. It's different from probably anywhere you've stayed. The doors that don't lead to AirBnB rooms lead to private art studios. There's a Trailer Park shopping mall, a bar, and a cafe downstairs. The only comparison I can make is to the famed McMenamins properties of Oregon and Washington, where they've taken historical buildings and turned them into lodging (and dining and drinking) establishments, like Edgefield. History buffs will love...""";
"9419,39933343,2015-07-27,7705305,Cathy,""Angielena greeted us and gave us a tour upon arrival.  It's a delightful historic building with high ceilings, wood floors in the bedrooms, vintage light fixtures, and tasteful decor.  The accommodations are pleasing without being fussy"; simple but not austere.  The Golden Sun room has a mini fridge, toaster oven, and microwave.  Artwork is hung around each room and in the hallway - showcasing not only Angielena's beautiful work but some of the other artists as well.;;
<br/>There is a real sense of community here, whether you're staying one night or many.  Sharing kitchen space made it easy to connect with other guests and artists.  The back porch is lovely first thing in the morning with your tea or coffee; and later in the evening with a friend.  ;;
"<br/>A few items of note : the entrance into the hotel is a full flight of stairs and there is no elevator.  The view out my window wasn't the best (a restaurant supply company yard filled with used equipment), and the Georgetown neighborhood is quite close to the King County Airport.  Planes on approach are sometimes pretty low - which is why there is sometimes the """"Georgetown Pause"""" in the middle of conversation while the planes fly in.  I didn't mind any of those things - but do be aware that this is not a quiet, pampering hotel.  Rather, staying here is a way to insert yourself right into the funky vibe of Georgetown!";;;
<br/>Georgetown is a colorful, vibrant neighborhood that is still a little on the wild side.  If you like to listen to live music, enjoy good food, good drink, and shop for excellent artwork, you'll enjoy staying here.  It's close to the downtown area, just a short drive or bus ride away.  There is a wonderful chocolate maker right across the street (Fran's).  The Georgetown Trailer Park Mall is right out the back door on weekends (which is a sweet attraction in its own right) and the neighborhood has lots of fun shops and places of business.  The Museum of Flight is close by - and of course lots of other cool things to see. I really enjoyed the proximity to many attractions. ;;;
<br/> I stayed here with my teen, and didn't worry about my safety. We did a fair bit of walking in the area, as his summer camp was a few blocks away.  SANCA circus camp was fantastic, and being able to stay within walking distance was PERFECT!!;;;
"<br/> Angielena is a wonderfully warm person and I am really grateful I had a chance to stay here.  I will be back - that's a certainty.

The room was very cozy, the bed was super comfortable and the little attached sitting room was a great addition to have my stuff spill over into since I was staying for a week. I didn't use the little kitchenette area (there were so many places to eat!) but the mini fridge was handy to keep my left overs in. The kitchen was located down the hall, and the bathroom a bit further. It was big and had a HUGE shower, with so many shower heads! It was a great thing to have after working 10 hour days standing and painting. Angielena was very attentive host and if I needed anything she was always just a text away. The whole building itself has a ton of history — and it's reflected in the nice hardwood floors and interiors. It is a very arts oriented since — there are many artists who rent out studios which was a very cool environment to be in! I would absolutely recommend this place if anyone wanted to be in the heart of Georgetown which feels like one of the last authentically Seattle neighborhoods.""";;;

The room itself was comfortable and in keeping with the area. Angielena was a dear and very easy to get on with and great at communicating quickly. If I'm ever back in Seattle I would love to come back here. """;;;
9419,79800515,2016-06-14,4337921,Steve,Angielena's place is clean and private.  She is an exemplary host and an Artist and Musician in her own right.  She is friendly and attentive to details to make the stay pleasant and informative.  She clued me into the current story of Seattle Arts and Georgetown and made me feel very welcome.  This stay reminded me of why Seattle is still a great place to visit and live.  I highly recommend this AIRBB. A+ rating. ;;;

The building is amazing but I really love that era  The room was great with the bedroom in one section and a seating and sudo kitchen in the other. It made for a great hang out. We enjoyed the back balcony also during the Saturday market in the parking lot. It was great to kick back with a few beers and watch people. There are two bars located on the first floor. ONe has only been opened a week. I would recommend them since they have mastered the art of making a strong drink. It was noisy for a while on Fri & Sat night but the fan in the room helped drown out the sounds so we could sleep. It is a great place and with the delites of Angielena, I consider this place a diamond in the rough.""";;;
"9419,83853688,2016-07-04,28514628,J,""My first time using airbnb is most likely my last time using airbnb. Terrible. The host is a nice person but did not follow through with her word and was casual with our personal safety and the safety of our luggage. ";;;
<br/>;;;
<br/>Punchline: 1) The host left our room door unlocked and OPEN with our luggage in. She also did not physically remove a WASP that was there when we arrive. 2) Airbnb customer service number is not listed, they are hard to contact and their cancellation policy is terrible. Although when I did speak to a representative she was very nice and accommodating.;;;
<br/> ;;;
<br/>The story: Booked June 1st thru 4th. Arrived earlier and texted her, she allowed us to check in early which was very nice of her. Got to the place, upstairs walk into a place that smelled old but we figured hey it has charm. We were introduced to a lady that makes soap. Angielena, her dog, the soap lady and her 2 dogs started to talk with us (luggage still in hand) for about 20 - 30min. They were nice, we were tired but excited. Were shown our room - smaller than the pictures, not charming at all, overlooks a dump (which wasn't a big deal to us). Since we were early she said there were things for the room that needed to be done like final touches in the bedroom with kind bars and towels etc. She talked a little bit about the neighborhood. Showed us the bathroom and gave us our keys.;;;
<br/>;;;
<br/>Issues: There was a WASP in our room cause the window was left open also making the room hot and muggy. ;;;
<br/>;;;
<br/>Promise: Angielena promised us she would get a container or jar and make sure to physically remove the wasp from our room. Additionally, she said after finishing the final touches she would leave the room locked.;;;
<br/>;;;
<br/>How we left the room: Left our bags in the room (under the impression they were safe) and assured the wasp will be removed.;;;
<br/>;;;
"<br/>Before we went back: Got a text in the evening informing us that she  """"checked for the wasp"""" multiples times and forgot to lock the door but closed it so our stuff is fine since everyone is trust worthy. ";;;
<br/>;;;
"<br/>What we found: Went back at night to find our room door half way OPEN WITHOUT LUGGAGE INSIDE. Sure we found neatly folded towels etc but WHO LEAVES THE DOOR OPEN AND UNLOCKED WITH other peoples stuff in IT! Also, no grantee the wasp wasn't going to decided to shows its face since she didn't really remove it. She """"checked"""" multiple times.  ";;;
<br/>;;;
"<br/>Ending: I contacted Airbnb, wanted my money back and left that night. We could not contact her for a while, then she was first apologetic, then nice then annoyed. Had us drop off the keys in the drop off box. She told Airbnb to refund our money if we delivered they keys ASAP. """;;;

"9419,90660250,2016-08-01,343467,Sudip,""The Place :";;;
<br/>Angielena's place has an old world charm all its own. It is located in a quiet, peaceful, safe & somewhat bohemian neighbourhood. It's about a short 15 minute bus ride from Downtown Seattle. Buses ply regularly from right outside her place. It is an ideal pad for exploring Seattle. The bathroom is done up rather lavishly. The kitchen has got all the amenities required for cooking meals. There is cutlery too. ;;;
<br/> ;;;
<br/>The Neighbourhood :;;;
<br/>There are coffee shops, bars & restaurants in the immediate vicinity. Her place is located in a quiet area. ;;;
<br/>;;;
<br/>My Stay :;;;
<br/>My stay @ Angielena's was a Super Experience. Seamless, Smooth, Warm and Very Comfortable. My room was very well appointed. It had all the necessary amenities and was very well appointed. It was very neat and clean. There was a feeling of personal touch everywhere. ;;;
<br/>;;;
<br/>The Person :;;;
<br/>She received me very warmly. I felt like I was meeting an old friend. She gave me plenty of maps, guides and assorted tourist info about Seattle that only a resident of Seattle can give. She explained the routes, etc very patiently to me. And gave me valuable tips about exploring Seattle. She did everything possible to make me feel at home. Her accommodation is far removed from hotel accommodation which is rather robotic and devoid of personal touch. And where guests are mere statistics. ;;;
<br/>;;;
<br/>I would very strongly recommend her place to anyone wanting to explore Seattle. I came back with M E M O R I E S. My trip to Seattle turned out to be much more than a pure touristy experience, thanks to  Angielena. Her recommendations about places to see and visit in Seattle stood me in good stead.;;;
<br/>;;;
<br/>Angielena is a hostess par excellence. She exudes warmth as does her place. She is a very gracious & affable person. The fact that she is so passionate about her place made my stay a very memorable one. She has an amazing eye for detail. Not only did I end up befriending Angielena, I befriended her two cute dogs too. ;;;
<br/>;;;
<br/>;;;
<br/>I would sum up my stay at Angielena's by saying :;;;

Highly recommended if you like exploring other parts of Seattle but still want to be within 30 min of downtown! """;;;

A ton of local coffee shops, restaurants, and boutiques are within a close walking distance. The bedroom was very cute and the pictures were very accurate. The bathroom was amazing and we didn't run into any troubles sharing the bathroom. The bus stop is across the street and it was an easy ride to downtown Seattle. Transportation to and from the airport was also very reasonable ($20 one way for an Uber). This place is definitely a hidden gem in Seattle!!! """;;;

She took the time to took about the building, places of interest, and took a genuine interest in myself and my family members who dropped me off. Great location within walking distance of several restaurants and bars. About a 15-20 minute Uber ride away from downtown Seattle -- if you leave by 6:30am. Would stay at Angielena's again!""";;;
"9419,99572284,2016-09-05,26179219,Morgan,""The detailed description is very accurate. The room was much cleaner than I expected for a building that old (completely clean, actually) and the shower is heaven. The only thing that surprised me was the slightly sketchy feeling to the location. The doors are all well secured so we did NOT feel unsafe. Ever. That's just something I think one should know ahead of time. There's a """"trailer park mall"""" below the porch and a dump of some sort out the window of this room. So if you're looking for views you won't find them here. But we weren't and we slept like babies. The bed is very comfortable and, unlike many places one often stays, there's an abundance of pillows! We didn't have time for the bar scene but we did try coffee and breakfast and the Conservatory and it was fantastic! (And I'm a coffee snob so that's saying a lot.) Overall, for a relatively budget friendly place in Seattle, this is a good choice. """;;;

I loved the Star Brass Bar, Georgetown brewing and Seattle Cider. <br/>The host was wonderfully polite and accommodating.

The room was beautifully arranged with a small separate room to read and meditate in. We were greeted by a beautiful heart Angielena and her cute doggies. The shower was so refreshing and at first being separate from the room I thought to be an issue was no issue at all.

When I first moved in Angielena graciously took me for a walk with her adorable doggies and gave me a tour of the area with places to eat and helpful tips.  She also always responded quickly and all of my needs were more than met when I was her guest.  I highly recommend this gem of an air b & b, it has great character, an amazing shower and it's set up and location make for a very cool and unique stay.

Or, just Uber it.  Georgetown smaller than other neighborhoods on Northside like Ballard, but just as fun and quirky.  The place was great, building was old yes, part of the charm. I loved walking down the halls, wrapped in 100 years of history. The bedroom room with sitting room never felt cramped.  Everything was clean and comfortable.  The shared bathroom very modern.  The back porch was joy to sit a relax.  The downstairs coffee shop perfect in morning, downstairs bar, perfect in the evening.  Yes, you are near airport, and might hear planes.  When staying at AirBnB, or any hotel, I always carry earplugs.  Once I went down for the night on that memory foam bed the plane sounds never woke me.  As Arnold says, """"I'll be back!""""""";;;

We did not really know what to expect when we booked a place south of downtown in a former industrial area. But we were not disappointed. To the contrary: We were pleasantly surprised and would not want to have missed this little gem! Angielena's is a very sweet host. She was flexible to our change of plans of coming earlier (due to heavy traffic in the downtown area and our decision to take the bus from Georgetown - only 20 minutes!) and took her time showing us around and explaining us where to find everything. We were there during the weekend, so we (unfortunately) did not meet any of the artists. The room and bathroom were very clean. There was a small kitchen that we did not use, but where you could cook if desired. We enjoyed staying at the back porch/veranda, and enjoying a drink on one of its cozy couches before going to bed. Our room consisted of two parts: the bedroom and a room with 2 armchairs and a fridge and toaster oven. We had everything we needed. The Georgetown neighbourhood is great, very eclectic. You will find bars, restaurants, cafes, tiny stores, etc. there. We would stay with Angielena again, if we come back to Seattle.""";;;

Angielena was very friendly, helpful, and accommodating. The building is right in the heart of Georgetown and has a bus stop that takes you downtown conveniently located across the street. There are plenty of coffee shops and restaurants within walking distance. Parking is available but limited at times because it is shared with the coffee shop and bar.<br/>The main reason we're rating it 3/5 stars is due to excessive noise levels that we experienced throughout our stay. While we had previously lived in Chicago for 5 years and the listing/other reviewers did note some noise, I feel it was understated. The property is located in close proximity to two airports, a train railway, and highway. It is also above a coffee shop that hosts live bands on weekend nights. There was constant noise coming from one (or more) of these sources, which made it difficult to sleep and even make a phone call at times.<br/>Overall, the stay was worth it due to it being budget friendly.

Angielena did a great job with orientation and answering my questions. Because the place is above a bar, there were noises from time to time, but they usually stopped by 11 pm. The location is close to a bus stop that brings you easily to downtown. There are also multiple pubs and restaurants around the area that are worth checking out. Although a kitchen and bathrooms are shared among the other tenants, I found that everyone was respectful of each other's space. I would recommend this location for other guests wanting to live in an historic building with lots of friendly artists!""";;;

"9419,416550335,2019-02-24,236358317,Shannon,""SAFE HAVEN WITH A SHARED EXPERIENCE IN AN ECLECTIC PLACE!!!  <br/>Historic location in the heart of Georgetown! Great introduction to an artsy treasure as Angielena was very welcoming, informative, and accommodating and remains as such currently. She is readily available most times and if not in person, she makes sure you’re taken care of. Thanks Rick!!! <br/>I couldn’t have stayed at a better location. It has that “Old Seattle” feel, with vintage aesthetics that are pleasing to the eye. Clean and heated room, comfortable bed, local art filled hallways, and gosh-the shower is heaven! It’s a shared experience but all rooms have locks. Shared bath, kitchen, and laundry located down the hall. <br/>Located right above a few bars/restaurants so the nightly noise can be an issue for some but there are quiet hours after 10 pm. If noisy after 10, the music is significantly lowered, which is great and very considerate. Less noisy during the weekdays. Also, the planes flying right above your head...lol-can be pretty amazing yet intense. <br/>Close proximity to public transportation (bus line 124), coffee, pubs, and restaurants. I would recommend Brother Joe (great coffee & brunch) and Square Knot Diner. <br/>I am here for a few more weeks as I transition to LA and would highly recommend a stay here at Angielena’s!""";;;

This place is very affordable and has immediate access to a highway. I was able to uber carpool to and from work in downtown Seattle in about 15 minutes, paying no more than 6 dollars each way. The place was extremely clean and all the tenants could not haver been nicer and more helpful. Angie and rick (the night manager) were always around if I ever had any questions and Angie always got back to me very quickly if I had to message her for anything. There is also a lot to do in the area around airport road and I very much look forward to making my way back here next summer!""";;;

Angielena has thoughtfully created spaces that are clean, bright and comfortable and that make visitors feel right at home! She provides just about everything you could find yourself needing -  towels AND robe/slippers"; not just shampoo & soap, but a choice of several to suit your hairtype &/or scent preference;" & bathrooms stocked with all the other little incidentals you may have left behind - qtips, cotton, bandaid, hairdryer, sunscreen, etc. I was never inconvenienced by the shared bathroom (the shower is divine!) or kitchen. Everyone I met was so super friendly and welcoming (starting with host Angielena!)<br/>The location can’t be beat! Georgetown is an arty, grungy, eclectic neighborhood full of good food and drinks, shops, and galleries - all right outside the door and easily within walking distance. It’s convenient to both downtown and the airport, but on the outskirts of the city, making it super easy to get anywhere you need to go -parking is easy, and public trans is handy.<br/>The building itself is pretty quiet, and seemed pretty well insulated against the train, truck, and plane noise in this working industrial part of town.<br/>A couple of things to be aware of though:<br/>- rooms are at the top of a wide but steep-ish staircase (you gotta carry your heavy suitcases up! & take care coming home after a late night out in the neighborhood bars!)<br/>- rooms ARE above street-level businesses (bar, cabaret) and depending on the night or programming, it can be loud (disco beats) or run late (2am+) - earplugs are provided, but checking the calendar for the nights’ programming is helpful in anticipating  potential noise.""";

If you're sensitive to sounds like I am, the sound from the pool hall and the planes felt like a dull roar/white noise - I was able to sleep through it pretty easily.

"9419,587038127093795536,2022-03-20,311278925,Kevyn,""For starters—I’ll say I don’t usually do public reviews. Because in the grand scheme of things how do you know which are real and which are not?<br/>That said—I’ll state that this is a real review. I’ll keep it short. My stay at this place was awesome to say the least. Angielena was very attentive and helpful and made me feel welcome from the moment she handed me the keys to the moment I handed them back. <br/>The vibe of the whole place is magical. The art that covers the walls makes you feel like you’re in an art museum. I found myself just wondering the halls from time to time, looking at all the amazing art pieces. <br/>There is no kitchen in the rooms themselves BUT another favorite part of mine was the community kitchen which includes all you need (cooking items, utensils, etc.) along with a sitting area packed with fun reading material and games. <br/>I have nothing bad to say about this place. The building is older so when walking through the halls and closing and opening doors it can be pretty loud. Also it’s right above a awesome pool hall so if you’re looking for more of a quiet getaway I wouldn’t suggest this place. <br/>I would suggest you try it out though. You can’t beat the price and it’s a short (20 min.) bus ride to downtown. <br/>This place gave me a maximalist vibe, with a new thing to look at at every turn. I’ll be coming back for sure!""";;;

The room was surprisingly quiet during the day. I recommend the earplugs on weekend nights for sleeping (host provides in the common kitchen), but the bar noise and airplanes were not so loud as to disturb evening activities. I’d love to gush over this this space more, but would rather keep it as a secret hideaway for myself.""";;;

Great value, spend your money on good food not on the exclusivity of your own bathroom. I really enjoyed the character of the building. This is a hotel from 1941, there were really cool transoms over all the doors to the rooms. Their was a great vibe all of the other guests were very friendly. I didn't have a problem with it but the building is close to Boeing airfield and you cane here the planes land. This is my first trip to Seattle (definitely not my last) that seems to be something they just deal with in this city. Their were plenty of restaurant's and bars un the block and 11 minutes away there is a Starbucks that opens  at 3:30am if you're on East coast time.

There wasn't a THING the owner hadn't thought of to accomodate us and make our stay the most special of our 6 day travel across Washington from Spokane to San Juan Island. My mother, sister, 18 yr old niece and I were ALL impressed and we were all so sad as we left. This lovely little place feels like you are home the minute you walk in. It was very quiet and felt like a world away from the hustle and bustle of downtown Seattle. We got to meet the host and just loved visiting with her and hearing the history of the home when we asked her to share it with us. I told her I would return with my husband in the fall so he can enjoy this lovely little jewel in West Seattle. I couldn't recommend a place any higher than Sweet Orange! """;;;

She was a pleasure to rent from.  The beds were extremely comfortable.  There are views of the Olympic mountains and Puget Sound from the deck, and the neighborhood is perfect for walking to all the restaurants, bakery's and shops of West Seattle.  Next visit to Seattle, I will certainly want to stay there again.  It could not have been more perfect.  Thanks Cassie!""";;;

The pictures on this site do not do the place justice.  Sometimes pictures look better than the real thing, but this is not the case with the Sweet Orange.  It is even better in person!  Cassie was a perfect host, checking in via text to make sure we had everything that we needed or if she could help us in any way.  We can not wait to go back!  My only regret was that it was snowing when we were there and didn't have the opportunity to utilize the lovely deck that has a view of the water.  Next time! ";;;

"9531,13784923,2014-06-04,5326609,Ingrid,""I returned to the Sweet Orange again this year. The home is absolutely gorgeous (I spent the first 30 minutes simply in awe the house). The care with which the detail and amenity of each room was furnished and decorated is surprising, and brings out all of its old world charms. It is comfortable, very clean, and provides you with all the things you need to feel like you are living in a second home. The house sits just behind California Ave SW, only a short block from Husky deli, bakeries, cafes, restaurants, bars, shops, and of course, Easy Street Records in Alaska Junction. Yet you would never know how close to the vibrant junction this home is, when sitting in the quiet and lush backyard garden. The highlight, I would say, is the deck overlooking the sound and evening sunsets.  Cassie is a friendly, generous, and kind host. She makes every accommodation to ensure her guests' comfort and convenience. I would not stay anywhere else in Seattle, and recommend this place to anyone.""";;;

Cassie is an awesome host and very detailed oriented from the local guide complete she created with maps and  thoughtful touches such as fresh half and half in the fridge and organic fresh ground coffee. The beds and bedding were extremely comfy like you would find in a 5 star hotel. West Seattle is super fun and amazing dining options are within walking distance from the Sweet Orange. Cassie must be a designer or knows one because the house is beautifully furnished and the paint colors complement each other so well. There is also beautiful views of the water from the dining and kitchen area. ";;;

<br/>We arrived from the east coast on a late flight, and were just exhausted when we arrived. Everything was ready for us, including lists of places that would deliver food. There were yoghurts and fresh fruit -- just what we needed before we collapsed into our (REALLY COMFORTABLE!) beds.;;;
<br/>In the morning, we discovered half-n-half and COFFEE - so welcome!! There were also common spices and all the dishes and pans we needed to make a few breakfasts there at the house. Trader Joe's was just a couple blocks away, as is the Sunday Farmer's Market. To our delight, the place was only a few blocks from our daughter's apartment. It looked further on the map.;;;
<br/>The Sweet Orange is so much more convenient and spacious than a couple of hotel rooms would have been for the same or greater cost. And my elderly Mom was able to nap and take care of herself much more easily and enjoyably. The decor is classy and clean and cheerful, and I was even able to do a couple loads of laundry. ;;;
<br/>Cassie thought of everything, even orange umbrellas for the inevitable Seattle showers. She even had shampoos and other toiletries, and a blow-dryer, in the linen closet.;;;
<br/>Just note, the place is not technically handicap accessible (the single bath includes a tub, not a step-in shower). The third sleeping area is a twin bed on a little porch off the Master bedroom, so your extra guest or child will have to traipse through the Master (our 22-yr-old son chose not to, but was comfortable on the couch). This was thoroughly detailed on the web description, so we were okay with it.;;;
<br/>We love West Seattle, and since our daughter and her new husband will be there for a while, we look forward to staying at the Sweet Orange again!;;;

It was great to be able to cook when we wanted to, yet be so close to the junction to grab a quick bite.  The house is beautiful, I wish I had your knack for decorating.  It was a great place to launch my runs from, and close enough to run Alki and Lincoln Park.  The space was perfect, everyone had room to spread out a little.  Much more enjoyable than a hotel.  It was fun discovering how West Seattle has changed since we moved.  Thank you for allowing us to stay.  """;;;

It was all around lovely. Cassie is the best airbnb host and we will use this home again as soon as we can! ;;;

She even left fresh half and half and butter in the fridge and had a lovely selection of local teas and coffee to consume.  The neighborhood was extremely convenient to the business section of West Seattle, although the street was residential and quiet day and night.  Very walkable area and extremely close to the wedding venue for which we were in town.  Also, the house was an easy drive into downtown Seattle.  I would recommend Cassie's cottage to anyone who wants a darling home away from home, and would go back in a heartbeat.  I have some physical impairments, so the bathroom was tight but it worked.  Lovely place and lovely hostess.  """;;;

Quick drive to Alki beach or Lincoln park which we and our dogs loved. Cassie (host) checked in on us enough to make sure our stay went smoothly  and was helpful and responsive with any requests.

Cassie was attentive and well organized and our check in and out was flawless.  She even arranged for us to work out at a fabulous gym nearby with a free 2 day pass, which is important as my son and I are fitness addicts.  The highlight of our stay was laying out on the porch and getting a suntan while looking over the bay after a long day of touring around the city.

So close to everything, I didn’t need a car for the 6 weeks I rented. And don’t get me started on how cute the place was. Beds are soooo comfortable and kitchen perfect for staying in and cooking. I worked out of the home and the desk with the view of the sound was perfect. Loved the sitting room where I sat with my coffee every day.  Fireplace in living room was my favorite. After weekends of hiking and eating at some of the best restaurants in the country, it was great to cozy up and fall asleep! <br/>Farmer’s Market is every Sunday. It is walkable and has the most beautiful flowers to decorate this adorable home!  And coffee shops all over the place! <br/>I’ve rented a lot of places in my travels, this is one of the best!""";;;

We especially loved the gas fireplace, the comfort of the beds, and the welcoming décor. We were amazed at how quiet it was inside the home, especially given the short, easy walk to the West Seattle Junction and to many nearby stores & restaurants. The outdoor areas were as lovely as the inside";" though, sadly, the weather didn't allow us to take much advantage of them. We had to work online during our time there and the wifi met all of our needs. Cassie was communicative and prompt when messaging, though not at all intrusive and a joy to work with. Her care of the home and her guests is evident. It was a great place to land for 2 weeks and we would absolutely book it in the future.""";;

We had everything we needed, including in the kitchen where we put together light meals.

We had such fun entertaining guests for meals and football games! We were there in January and didn’t use the patios or barbecue, but they would be delightful in sunny warm weather. We did see some beautiful sunsets! The location for us was perfect—close to our Kids' homes, close to Alki Beach, and close to the adventures of the Alaska Junction where you’ll find fun restaurants, grocery needs, and boutiques within walking distance. The parking pass for a spot right in front of the house is such a bonus! This beautiful little home became “ours” for 7 days and we’ll for sure be back.  :)""";;;

We loved the space, the period light fixtures and decor, the stained glass door and windows, crown moldings, comfy bedding, peak-a-boo sound views and especially the cozy gas fireplace. The indoor and outdoor sitting porches were also welcoming places to relax. For anyone less familiar with the West Seattle junction, Cassie’s place is easy walking distance to multiple grocery stores, bars, restaurants and shops and the kitchen was well outfitted to cook in if desired. There is also easy and reliable C Line direct bus access to downtown Seattle, a stay could be easily done without a rental car.

Cassie was extremely helpful in being flexible and accommodating on key pickup, arrival time, and allergy concerns. We arrived to fresh oranges and a chocolate bar on the table (a nice treat!). The fridge was stocked with condiments, and there was tea, spices and coffee. The place was extremely clean and Cassie provided us a walk through describing rules (very few, and all reasonable) for our stay. It is a great space and does not feel like a basement! Extremely colorful and the french doors opening up onto the patio provided great air flow throughout the apartment. The neighborhood was great- just a few blocks from the Junction and a free shuttle to get to the water taxi that takes you downtown! My in-laws had a great time and this place helped make their stay in Seattle extra special.""";;;

The Junction neighborhood was easy to navigate with plenty of restaurant and coffee shop options and off-the-cut enough that we didn't feel like we were in all the bustle of downtown.   That being said, we did quite a bit of running around during our time there and it was easy and quick to access the highway.   The home was clean, homey, charming, and offered everything we needed.  I was sorry to leave and would eagerly stay here again on our next visit!   Just a note: the bedrooms are separated from the common areas by heavy drapes, it worked out great for our stay and allowed for an open floorplan when we weren't sleeping but worth mentioning depending on who you are traveling with!";;;

I just don't know where to begin - the Tangerine Dream was adorable and is even cuter (and roomier) than the pictures show. We were very impressed with the amenities and it is always nice to see small details, like spices, silverware, glasses, extra lotions, shampoos, etc. It really felt like a home away from home for us - it was cozy, warm, and inviting. Also, the neighborhood was excellent! This was our first time in Seattle, but we honestly like we were a part of the community and the neighborhood. We felt very safe and we were able to walk to several restaurants and shops, and we had a wonderful time exploring the area. Cassie was a wonderful host and she was proactive in her communication - before questions even came up, she had already messaged and answered them. She was very accommodating, friendly, and personable, and she was readily available if we had a question. The next time we stay in Seattle - and we are DEFINITELY coming back - we will book the Tangerine Dream! Best vacation EVER!""";;;

Cassie was great at communicating and made sure we had everything we needed. We felt right at home during our stay. I particularly enjoyed making coffee in the french press and enjoying it at the table on the back porch looking at the garden. Fantastic location - in a quiet neighborhood but just a few short blocks away from adorable shops and restaurants. Proximity to Alki Beach was also a plus - we watched the sunset from there.

The neighborhood is wonderful.  Cassie's home really is the Tangerine Dream. It looks just like the pictures and even better. One nice afternoon, I walked to Trader Joe's and another evening we enjoyed a fire while it rained. I regret we didn't have time to walk over to the Farmers' Market.  If you visit, you can expect a beautifully hand-crafted designed home with lots of privacy including the great outdoor  area too.  Cassie's artistic tilework throughout is unbelievable.

The indoor is painted and tiled whimsically in bright earth tones with a little gas stove for any chilly days. The whole apartment feels spacious and includes most every amenity you might need - even for a longer stay. The neighborhood is walkable and picturesque.

Cassie has done a great job creating a place that really feels like home--we were visiting family in West Seattle, and we were so happy and felt so lucky to return to The Tangerine each evening. Comfortable beds, a well-equipped kitchen, warm and whimsical decor, a cozy gas fireplace stove, beautiful outdoor patio, convenient laundry, private parking space. Super-quiet and private-feeling, but 7 minutes' easy walk to The Junction, where we grabbed several meals and also visited the Farmers' Market. Scrupulously clean and well-maintained. Best for relatively quiet guests as there is some noise transfer to the upstairs unit--but this was not a problem or surprise for us, since Cassie was a great communicator throughout the whole process.

Super close to The Junction and all the great fun to be had there.

The home is styled and curated in such a thoughtful, comfortable, artistic and welcoming way!!! The little fireplace is a delight on the colder November days and nights. The super fun tile work is a treat—I kept finding cool, cute details all week.  There are so many comfortable spots—for reading, napping, writing, —indoors and out!  We also appreciated the sizey bathroom, and well-equipped kitchen.  Cassie also welcomed our little Boston Terrier, Lola.  She was so happy here, too!  None of us wanted to leave!!

<br/>;;;
"<br/>We're only giving this a 3 star rating because of a few negatives.  First, being a basement apt you could hear every move of the tenants upstairs.  Joyce (owner) was very quiet but when there were other renters above us the noise was a bit too much.  Second, upon arrival the apt was dirty.  Not Joyce's fault, but it appeared their cleaners did a very poor job and it was not checked/inspected before we arrived.  Lastly, a few days before our arrival the host contacted us and requested to """"rent back"""" the unit for one weekend of our 3 week stay because of family emergency.  Our only options were to vacate the apt or have our entire reservation cancelled (which would have left us with no where to stay and very little options given how busy Seattle summer season is).  It all worked out, but this was unwanted stress, not an ideal situation, and not something I'd expect to happen if you are running a """"business"""" of renting your home and apt.";;;

Her dining recommendations were spot on (still craving the cobb salad at Essential Baking and had great breakfast nearby at Irwin's).  The space is nicely decorated.  She left us fruit, tea, coffee and snacks!  Public transit into Seattle proper is fast, cheap and easy by bus caught just a block away. We also used the hourly bikes to get around the area.  Beds were comfortable with tons of pillows and blankets.  We will most definitely be back again! Thanks for being a great host, Joyce!""";;;

"9596,318546219,2018-09-03,167131867,Anazarry,""Joyce's lovely detailed touches to the place made a huge difference for us girls during our stay. The place had filtered water for us in the fridge, tea, chips, popcorn. Every morning we made tea and used the tea pot. The bathroom had more than enough clean towels and toilet paper for three girls. There were fully equipped toiletries incase one of us forgot tooth paste or Q-tips. Thank goodness there was a hair dryer too. The jewelry dishes for us ladies to place our jewelry was a lovely touch. There were maps for us tourist, books in the bedroom, especially the book, Sons of the Profits from the Seattle Underground tour, which we bought tickets for. All of Joyce's small touches to place was very much appreciated. <br/>My two friends and me occupied the space Labor Day weekend. We checked-in Friday and checked-out Monday. I suggest you message Joyce ahead of time, her response is not as instant but she is very kind and accommodating. She allowed us to check-in early on the first day. On our last day she allowed us to leave our luggage till 3 p.m. when check-out was at 11a.m. (Our flight was at 7 p.m. and it would have been difficult to drag our luggage around Pike Place on our last day. Thanks to Joyce she let us leave our luggage till the afternoon.)<br/>The bed and the sofa bed have a soft- sinking type mattress, so if you do have back issues and need a firm mattress, you may have trouble sleeping. Overall, we were very comfortable and grateful for our stay.  Thanks Joyce!""";;;

This IS a basement apartment, which means it smells like a basement (musty and damp), it sounds like a basement (footsteps overhead, heating/cooling elements clicking, etc.), it looks like a basement (ducts visible in the ceiling, corners and dark nooks you don't want to look in). Beware not to lock the front door knob! (there is no key for it, but it's OK because the kitchen window does not lock.) It's a good value for Seattle, in a really nice neighborhood,  close to and easy to reach everything the city has to offer.""";;;

"25002,47792,2010-05-30,119746,Chad,""The images of the room do not do it justice. It is a large, well furnished room that Amanda continues to improve. It is a very nice, comfortable place to stay with all of the convenience of home. I felt very safe in the neighborhood if you are unfamiliar with the area. There are many local places to eat, shop, and explore in Ballard. Right next door is Freemont, which has even more to offer. An easily accessible bus can take you downtown in 15-20 minutes.";;;

<br/>Amanda is a great hostess, willing to help out in any way possible. She also knows a lot about the city if you need some help finding things to do.;;;

We had everything we needed for a lovely stay- very comfortable bed- great coffee- nice bowl of fruit and very addictive chocolate cake.  Amanda told us about a bakery 3 blocks away, that might be worth the visit all by itself.  Amanda's is not luxurious, except for everything that is important.""";;;

And what a bonus to have such great accomodations.  The room was large and lovely; I felt at home immediately.  Amanda, thoughtfully, had provided a book of Seattle attractions which we used to guide us over to Green Lake and enjoyed a brisk walk around the lake on a gorgeous summer afternoon.  After a late dinner in the U district (but there are two restaurants nearby that we'll try next time) we settled down for the night in bliss -- absolute peace and quiet ...and the most comfortable bed.  I sometimes have trouble falling asleep when I'm out of town;" not here.  A bite of fresh fruit in the morning, and we were on our way to the cruise ship terminal, rested and refreshed.

I was greeted with a place of homemade brownies, fruit, and milk in the fridge, a private bathroom full of conveniences, and warm helpfulness.  I was traveling light, so things like extra bathroom items, lotion and shampoo, were especially welcome as was the use of Amanda's washer and drier. There are restaurants and shop within walking distance, and the area is perfect for early morning runs, or walks to pick up a paper. It was also great to see Luisa wearing English World Cup Team socks, and to have my only decent cup of tea on my travels - British people take note!""";;;

"25002,70100,2010-07-28,144662,Rebecca,""I went to Seattle for a training at UW (and to write) and  I couldn't have found a better place to stay!  The bed was comfy, the coffee was amazing, the place was very clean (and newly remodeled, including the bathroom), and Amanda and Luisa were incredibly welcoming.  As soon as I walked into the apartment the cheerful, warm vibe hit me (as did the delicious fruit and cookies)!  It is close to two lines of public transport, and within walking distance of several cafes and good restaurants.  I was traveling alone, didn't have a car, and felt totally safe walking the three residential blocks back from the bus stop at 1AM (if you drive, there seems to be tons of street parking).  The yard is gorgeous, and I spent many a morning sipping coffee on the deck.  Amanda and her daughter are both wonderful hosts"; they possess a nice blend of laid-back and accommodating.  Amanda teaches elementary school and is very interesting to talk to, and pointed me in the direction of some great things to do in Seattle and Ballard.  (The Ballard Locks/English garden was a nice half-hour walk, and Phinney/Greenwood about fifteen minutes).  The bus to Fremont took less than ten, and my trip to the university was 45 minutes, tops.  ;;

We were able to prepare light meals which is great when you are on the road a long time.  But just around the corner are several restaurants and a great French bakery/coffee bar (some of the best croissants to be had in Seattle).

25002,195833,2011-03-10,349513,Louis,We had a great week at Amanda's apartment.  Very clean and comfy....will become our home away from home when we visit our grandson.  Walking distance to everything you need.;;;
"25002,201772,2011-03-17,410045,Gemma,""My boyfriend and I stayed at Amanda's studio in Ballard, and hada  wonderful time. Her studio is is comfortable with an AMAZING bed and brand new bathroom, and there were the most delicious brownies waiting for us when we arrived. It's little touches like this that set's Amanda apart and makes for a lovely stay. Her place is very near all the action in Ballard, which is a very cute and trendy neighbourhood.Infact, we only ventured into the city centre once as Ballard has it all. There is a fantastic bakery, pizza place and Mexican within walking distance. I would definitely recommend Amanda's place to anyone staying in Seattle.""";;;

My parents stayed at her place while they were visiting me, and they had a great, cozy experience. Amanda is easy to connect with in person and by email and phone. Her home is in a quiet area on a quiet street that is well-located for getting around and enjoying places like Ballard and Fremont (neighborhoods in Seattle).""";;;

"25002,250724,2011-05-03,284455,Chandra,""Amanda was a friendly host and her space was clean, well-located,  spacious and fairly comfortable.  Lots of people haved raved about the bed which perhaps inflated my expectations"; I found it to be pretty  standard (however I did appreciate that it was placed to allow access from both sides).  The only caveat is that due to its basement-location, it can be slightly musty (even with the windows open), so if that is an issue for you it might not be the best fit (however I am admittedly rather hyper-sensitive to that sort of thing so it is probably fine for most people).  The garden is lovely and there was plenty of light from the windows;" it doesn't feel like you are in a basement since the door opens into it from the front yard.  Amanda was easy to talk to and had great recommendations for local eateries.  She also very considerately left a lovely bowl of fruit for us to enjoy when I mentioned that we would prefer not to have brownies or cookies in the room.  Thanks Amanda!""";

We had no problem getting around using public transportation (there are bus stops within a couple blocks), although in retrospect it would have been nice to have a car.  Easy check in and lots of little touches, like a variety of teas and brownies upon arrival, made this a wonderful stay.  """;;;

Wonderful bed, lots of pillows, extra linens and towels also provided.  Room was originally the garage (under the house), now finished off very professionally.  Newly added bathroom (with heated tile floor) is a few steps away in the unfinished basement.  Washer/dryer/iron & ironing board also in the basement, and Amanda generously offered to let me use them.  Beautiful yard and back deck, vegetable garden, quiet street, lovely neighborhood, ample parking.

There's a hairdryer and shampoo and even tampons in case you find yourself in that situation. Tons of closet and drawer space, and even an iron to press your clothes. There was always parking on the street and the neighborhood is very cute. If I ever return to Seattle I would definitely consider staying here again. The price is certainly right for all that you get! """;;;
